1. Backend: Use Mybatis to implement persistence layer (dao) operations to operate on database information; Use Spring to operate on the service layer, verify and format the data transmitted by the persistence layer. Use springMVC to operate on the controller layer, and use a series of annotations to obtain the request information from the front-end page and hand it over to the business layer. Use Model and View for view rendering
2. Frontend: Contains HTML CSS JavaScript, which will add the Vue front-end framework in the future
